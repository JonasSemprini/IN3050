<h1 align=center"> IN3050 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning </h1>
  
<h3 align="center"> Course Description </h3> 

This course gives a basic introduction to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Through an algorithmic approach, the students are given a practical understanding of the methods being taught, in particular through making their own implementations of several of the methods. The course covers supervised classification based on e.g., artificial neural networks (deep learning), as well as unsupervised learning (clustering), regression, optimization (evolutionary algorithms and other search methods) and reinforcement learning, in addition to design of experiments and evaluation. Students also receive an introduction to philosophical fundamental problems and ethical questions related to ML/AI, as well as the field's history.
